# JavaScript Gauntlet

A webpage that presents a timed multiple-choice quiz on the basics of JavaScript


## Introduction 

The JavaScript Gauntlet is a website where JavaScript programmers can come to test their knowledge of JavaScript trivia. Users are given a set amount of time to answer multiple-choice questions; correct answers increase their score, whereas incorrect answers deduct time remaining on the quiz. When the quiz is over, users are invited to save their score alongside their initials for posterity.
