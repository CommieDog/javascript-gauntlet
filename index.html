                <p>
                    So you've signed up for a coding bootcamp and you're two weeks into it. You think you're hot stuff, don't you? Look at you, you're declaring variables, writing functions that take other functions as arguments,
                    and spitting out <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/do...while"><code>do...while</code> loops</a> like they're nothing. You want to show the world (and those
                    senior web developers) what you're capable of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or maybe you're a senior web developer who has been using JavaScript since its inception. I'll bet you're sick and tired of coding bootcamp cadets telling you how smart they are. You need a tool that will show
                    them just how little they really know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Either way, you've come to the right place! This website comes equipped with a simple quiz that will test your JavaScript knowledge like never before. You'll be given a set amount of time to answer JavaScript-related
                    questions, presented in a convenient multiple-choice format. Answer correctly, and you'll earn points. Answer incorrectly, and you'll lose time as a penalty. When time is up, the quiz is over and you'll have a
                    chance to save your initials alongside your score into the browser's local storage for eternal glory (or shame).
